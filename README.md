# Flipkart-sentimental-Analysis
The Flipkart Sentiment Analysis project is aimed at analysing customer sentiments based on product reviews available on the Flipkart e-commerce platform. The project utilizes Python programming language and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify and understand the sentiment expressed in the reviews.

Steps to follow:-
1. Download the zip file of the project.
2. Run app.py on any desired platform as i used VS Code.
3. Download all the python modules first if there is any error found.
4. Run the HTML, CSS, Javascript

The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection: The first step is to gather a substantial amount of review data from Flipkart. This can be achieved by utilizing Flipkart's API or by scraping the website using web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. The collected data should consist of review text and corresponding sentiment labels.

Data Preprocessing: Once the review data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. This includes removing any irrelevant information such as HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters. Additionally, text normalization techniques like lowercasing, stemming, and lemmatization can be applied to reduce variations in the text.

Feature Extraction: To train a sentiment analysis model, relevant features need to be extracted from the preprocessed text. This can be done using various techniques, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe. These features will represent the textual data in a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Sentiment Classification: Once the features are extracted, a machine learning model can be trained to classify the sentiment of the reviews. Popular algorithms for sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or more advanced deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers.

Model Evaluation: The trained sentiment analysis model needs to be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps assess the performance and effectiveness of the model in classifying sentiments accurately.

Deployment and Interface: Finally, the sentiment analysis model can be deployed to predict sentiments on new and unseen Flipkart reviews. This can be achieved by building a user-friendly interface, such as a web application or a command-line tool, where users can input review text and obtain sentiment predictions as output.

Throughout the project, libraries and frameworks such as Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Scikit-learn, Keras, or TensorFlow can be utilized for various NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

By conducting sentiment analysis on Flipkart reviews, this project aims to provide valuable insights into customer opinions and sentiments towards specific products, allowing businesses to gain a better understanding of their customer base and make informed decisions regarding product improvements or marketing strategies.
